## Workshop on Assessing Cardiovascular Risk in a Synthetic Patient Cohort

This repo consists of a workshop to teach students about using clinical and genetic covariates to predict cardiovascular risk in a realistic (but synthetic) dataset.

The workshop has two parts:

  1. **Night 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis**
  2. **Night 2 - Machine Learning using Decision Trees**
  
##Night 1 Program:

##Task 1. Asking the Question â€“ Background of the problem, Intro to clinical data (20 min)

**Learning Objective**: Understand the potential risk factors of cardiovascular disease and its impact on healthcare. *Format*: [Short Lecture](slides/Dorr_risk_score_basics.pptx) (15 minutes) + Questions

##Task 2. Simple CVD Risk Score Calculations (10 min)

**Learning objective**: To perform a simple assessment of risk factors associated with the outcomes. *Format*: [Brief demonstration/slides](slides/Dorr_risk_score_basics.pptx) (10 mins), then work time. *Output*: calculation of risk scores for various cohorts of interest.

##Task 3. Exploring the Data and Selecting a Cohort (60 min)

**Learning Objective**: Given the data set, what are the problems with the current dataset? Using EDA tools to understand issues with the clinical variables and come up with solutions to clean it. *Format*: [Short Lecture](introToEDA.html) (10 minutes) + Interactive Workshop. *Output*: Selection of Clinical Cohort for later analysis.
 
###Task 4. Discussion so far (30 mins)

**Learning Objective**: Discussion of Clinical Data and Cardiovascular risk. How well did we do? How can we do better?
